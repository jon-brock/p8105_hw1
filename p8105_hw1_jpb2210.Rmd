## Problem #1
###### (*25 points*)
##### *Create a data frame with specific inclusions:*

```{r create_data_frame_1}
set.seed(134) #I set a random seed for the sake of consistency and reproducibility
prob1_df <- tibble(
    vec_numeric = rnorm(8),
    vec_logical = vec_numeric > 0,
    vec_character = c("beat", "cream", "fold", "glaze", "knead", "score", "whip", "whisk"),
    vec_factor = factor(c("good", "neutral", "bad", "good", "neutral", "bad", "good", "bad"))
)
```

##### *Taking the mean value of each vector within our data frame:*

The mean value of `vec_numeric` is `r round(mean(pull(prob1_df, vec_numeric)), digits = 3)`.  
The mean value of `vec_logical` is `r round(mean(pull(prob1_df, vec_logical)), digits = 3)`.  
The mean value of `vec_character` is `r mean(pull(prob1_df, vec_character))`.  
The mean value of `vec_factor` is `r mean(pull(prob1_df, vec_factor))`.  

We see that we are unable to take the mean value from `vec_character` and `vec_factor`. Additionally, while we did take a mean value from `vec_logical` it's merely a mean of 0's and 1's.

```{r vector_conversions_1, eval = FALSE}
vec_log_num <- as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, vec_logical))
vec_char_num <- as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, vec_character))
vec_fac_num <- as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, vec_factor))

#I used the following three lines of code in order to verify that my previous code was successful
vec_log_num
vec_char_num
vec_fac_num
```  
By using the `as.numeric()` function on our logical, character, and factor variables we converted them into numerical values:  
  
* Logical vectors have two values, `TRUE` and `FALSE`, which were converted into `1` and `0`, respectively  
* Character vectors are unable to be coerced into numerical vectors, hence why we got `NA` for output (not shown)  
* Factor vectors get coerced into their respective `levels = ...` and are assigned a numeric value for each level

This explains why we were able to pull the mean value of some vectors, but not with other vectors (i.e., `character`)

##### *Create a second code chunk with multiple conversions and operations:*
```{r vector_conversions_2, warning = FALSE}
vec_log2num_prod <- as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, vec_logical)) * pull(prob1_df, vec_numeric)
vec_log2num_prod  

vec_log2fac_prod <- as.factor(pull(prob1_df, vec_logical)) * pull(prob1_df, vec_numeric)
vec_log2fac_prod

vec_log2fac2num_prod <- as.numeric(as.factor(pull(prob1_df, vec_logical))) * pull(prob1_df, vec_numeric)
vec_log2fac2num_prod
```

## Problem #2
###### (*25 points*)
##### *Create a data frame with specific inclusions:*

```{r create_data_frame_2}
set.seed(53) #I set a random seed for the sake of consistency and reproducibility
prob2_df <- tibble(
    x = rnorm(500),
    y = rnorm(500),
    vec_logical_p2 = x + y > 1,
    vec_numeric_p2 = as.numeric(vec_logical_p2),
    vec_factor_p2 = as.factor(vec_logical_p2)
)
```
Let me tell you a few fun facts about `prob2_df`:  

1. The data frame has `r nrow(prob2_df)` rows and `r ncol(prob2_df)` columns  
1. The variable 'x' has:  
  * a mean value of `r round(mean(pull(prob2_df, x)), digits = 3)`  
  * a median value of `r round(median(pull(prob2_df, x)), digits = 3)`  
  * a standard deviation of `r round(sd(pull(prob2_df, x)), digits = 3)`    
1. The proportion of cases for which `x + y > 1` is `r round(mean(pull(prob2_df, vec_numeric_p2)), digits = 3)`

```{r yx_scatterplot_logical, include = FALSE}
p8105_hw1_plot1 <- ggplot(prob2_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = vec_logical_p2)) + geom_point()
```

```{r yx_scatterplot_numeric, include = FALSE}
p8105_hw1_plot2 <- ggplot(prob2_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = vec_numeric_p2)) + geom_point()
```

```{r yx_scatterplot_factor, include = FALSE}
p8105_hw1_plot3 <- ggplot(prob2_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = vec_factor_p2)) + geom_point()
```

```{r display_plots, fig.align = "center"}
#Two colors reflect the two values of the logical vector (TRUE/FALSE)  
p8105_hw1_plot1  
#A color gradient reflects the range of possible values of the numeric vector;  
#only two values are in this particular vector (0,1)  
p8105_hw1_plot2  
#Two colors reflect the two levels of the factor vector (TRUE/FALSE)  
p8105_hw1_plot3  
```

##### *Save the first generated plot to the project directory*
```{r yx_scatterplot_save}
ggsave(filename = "hw1_prob2_plot1.png", plot = p8105_hw1_plot1)
```
