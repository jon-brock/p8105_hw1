## Problem #1
###### (*25 points*)
##### *Create a data frame with specific inclusions:*

```{r create_data_frame_1}
prob1_df <- tibble(
    vec_numeric = rnorm(8),
    vec_logical = vec_numeric > 0,
    vec_character = c("beat", "cream", "fold", "glaze", "knead", "score", "whip", "whisk"),
    vec_factor = factor(c("good", "neutral", "bad", "good", "neutral", "bad", "good", "bad"))
)
```
***

##### *Taking the mean value of each vector within our data frame:*

The mean value of `vec_numeric` is `r mean(pull(prob1_df, vec_numeric))`.  
The mean value of `vec_logical` is `r mean(pull(prob1_df, vec_logical))`.  
The mean value of `vec_character` is `r mean(pull(prob1_df, vec_character))`.  
The mean value of `vec_factor` is `r mean(pull(prob1_df, vec_factor))`.  

We see that we are unable to take the mean value from `vec_character` and `vec_factor`. Additionally, while we did take a mean value from `vec_logical` it's merely a mean of 0's and 1's.

```{r vector_conversions, eval = FALSE}

## Problem #2
###### (*25 points*)
##### *Create a data frame with specific inclusions:*

```{r create_data_frame_2}
set.seed(25) #I set a random seed for the sake of consistency and reproducibility
prob2_df <- tibble(
    x = rnorm(500),
    y = rnorm(500),
    vec_logical_p2 = x + y > 1,
    vec_numeric_p2 = as.numeric(vec_logical_p2),
    vec_factor_p2 = as.factor(vec_logical_p2)
)
```
Let me tell you a few fun facts about my Problem #2 data frame:  

    1. The data frame has `r nrow(prob2_df)` rows and `r ncol(prob2_df)` columns.  
    2. The variable 'x' has:  
        - a mean value of `r mean(pull(prob2_df, x))`  
        - a median value of `r median(pull(prob2_df, x))`, and  
        - a standard deviation of `r sd(pull(prob2_df, x))`.  
    3. The proportion of cases for which `x + y > 1` is XX.

```{r yx_scatterplot_logical, include = FALSE}
p8105_hw1_plot1 <- ggplot(prob2_df) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = x, y = y, color = vec_logical_p2))
```

```{r yx_scatterplot_numeric, include = FALSE}
p8105_hw1_plot2 <- ggplot(prob2_df) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = x, y = y, color = vec_numeric_p2))
```

```{r yx_scatterplot_factor, include = FALSE}
p8105_hw1_plot3 <- ggplot(prob2_df) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = x, y = y, color = vec_factor_p2))
```

```{r display_plots, fig.align = "center"}
p8105_hw1_plot1
p8105_hw1_plot2
p8105_hw1_plot3
```

***

##### *Save the first generated plot to the project directory*
```{r yx_scatterplot_save}
ggsave(filename = "hw1_prob2_plot1.png", plot = p8105_hw1_plot1)
```
