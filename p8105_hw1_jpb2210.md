Problem \#1
-----------

##### *Create a data frame with specific inclusions:*

``` r
prob1_df <- tibble(
    vec_numeric = rnorm(8),
    vec_logical = vec_numeric > 0,
    vec_character = c("beat", "cream", "fold", "glaze", "knead", "score", "whip", "whisk"),
    vec_factor = c("good", "neutral", "bad", "good", "neutral", "bad", "good", "bad")
)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### *Taking the mean value of each vector within our data frame:*

The mean value of `vec_numeric` is -0.1763672.
The mean value of `vec_logical` is 0.25.
The mean value of `vec_character` is NA.
The mean value of `vec_factor` is NA.

We see that we are unable to take the mean value from `vec_character` and `vec_factor`. Additionally, while we did take a mean value from `vec_logical` it's merely a mean of 0's and 1's.

``` r
#THIS SECTION IS PENDING COMPLETION.
```
